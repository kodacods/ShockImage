## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

# User Guide

**Transform image to black and white**

Select 'Greyscale' under the 'Colour' menu, the image will be transformed into black and white. To revert the image back to colour, the undo button must be selected after the image has been transformed to Greyscale. If other edits have been made to the image after Greyscale has been applied, you must undo all edits until you reach the Greyscale undo.


**Adjust contrast**

To change the contrast of the image, click the 'Contrast' button under the 'Colour' menu. You will be presented with a pop up menu that allows you to change the contrast by -25%, 0% or 100%. Use the arrows to make your selection. Once you have selected the amount you would like to change the contrast press 'Ok' and the image will be tranformed to the new paramters. You can increase and decrease contrast on already edited images. Sometimes when an image's contrast is edited, it's pixel colour can slightly change due to keeping it within range of 0 to 255, if wanting to revert the image back to it's original contrast it is best to use undo once the contrast has been adjusted. If other edits have been made to the image after contrast has been applied, you must undo all edits until you reach the contrast undo.

**Adjust brightness**

To change the brightness of the image, click the 'Brightness' button under the 'Colour' menu. You will be presented with a pop up menu that allows you to change the brightness by -25%, 0% or 100%. Use the arrows to make your selection. Once you have selected the amount you would like to change the brightness press 'Ok' and the image will be tranformed to the new paramters. You can increase and decrease brightness on already edited images. Sometimes when an image's brightness is edited, it's pixel colour can slightly change due to keeping it within range of 0 to 255, if wanting to revert the image back to it's original brightness it is best to use undo once the brightness has been adjusted. If other edits have been made to the image after brightness has been applied, you must undo all edits until you reach the brightness undo. 

**Change the langague of ANDIE**

To change the language of the interface, select 'Change language / Sprache Ã¤ndern' under the 'Language / Sprache' menu. You will be presented with a pop up menu that will allow you to select either 'English' or 'Deutsch'. Once you have selected your preferred language press 'Ok'. The pop up menu will close. You will then need to exit the application and re-open it. Once it is re-opened all words will be changed to the language that was selected. You can change language at any time repeating the steps above.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
